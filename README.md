# DLSU CCS Starter Pack üéí

A quick-start guide for **College of Computer Studies** students at **De La Salle University**‚Äîdesigned to help you hit the ground running in **CCPROG1: Logic Formulation and Introductory Programming** and may expand to cover other courses such as the Math Series.

This repository is based on the official **CCPROG1** syllabus with beginner-friendly explanations, practice exercises, and tool setup guides so you can focus on learning, not just figuring out your environment.
