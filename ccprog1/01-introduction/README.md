# Introduction (Logic Formulation, C Structure, Tokens & Expressions)

This module introduces the foundations of programming and logical thinking.  
Before writing real C programs, you‚Äôll learn **what programming is**, **how to plan solutions**, and how to represent them using **flowcharts and pseudocode**.
