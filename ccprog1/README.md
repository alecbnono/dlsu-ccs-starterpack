## ðŸ“š How to Use This Guide

1. **Start at `00-getting-started/`** to set up your tools:
   - Install your compiler (GCC).
   - Set up a text editor/IDE.
   - Learn basic terminal commands.
2. **Progress through each module in order**, reading the explanations and doing the activities.
3. **Complete the checkpoints** at the end of each module before moving on.
